# This is the English help file for Open MPI's BXI support.
#
[dlopen disabled]
Open MPI was compiled without dynamic library support (e.g., with the
 --disable-dlopen flag), and therefore cannot utilize UBCL support.

If you need UBCL support, reconfigure Open MPI with dynamic library support enabled.
#
[dlopen failed]
The library attempted to open the following UBCL libraries,
but each of them failed. UBCL cannot be used.
%s
If you need to use UBCL, then try setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the location
of libubcl.so to get passed this issue.
#
[No memory]
A call to allocate memory within the UBCL support failed.  This is
an unrecoverable error and will cause the program to abort.
  Hostname:  %s
