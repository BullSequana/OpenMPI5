Open MPI v6.0.x series
======================

This file contains all the NEWS updates for the Open MPI v6.0.x
series, in reverse chronological order.

Open MPI version v6.0.0
--------------------------
:Date: ...fill me in...

- Open MPI now requires a C11-compliant compiler to build.

- Open MPI now requires Python >= |python_min_version| to build the
  Fortran MPI bindings (or when building from a Git clone).

  - Open MPI has always required Perl to build; our Perl scripts are
    slowly being converted to Python.

- Removed ROMIO package.

- Added MPI-4.1 ``MPI_Status_*`` functions.
