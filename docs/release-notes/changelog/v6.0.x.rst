Open MPI v6.0.x series
======================

This file contains all the NEWS updates for the Open MPI v6.0.x
series, in reverse chronological order.

Open MPI version v6.0.0
--------------------------
:Date: ...fill me in...

- Added support for the MPI-4.0 embiggened APIs (i.e., functions with
  ``MPI_Count`` parameters).

- Fix build system and some internal code to support compiler
  link-time optimization (LTO).

- Open MPI now requires a C11-compliant compiler to build.

- Open MPI now requires Python >= |python_min_version| to build.

  - Open MPI has always required Perl 5 to build (and still does); our
    Perl scripts are slowly being converted to Python.

  .. note:: Open MPI only requires Python >= |python_min_version| and
            Perl 5 to build itself.  It does *not* require Python or
            Perl to build or run Open MPI or OSHMEM applications.

- Removed the ROMIO package.  All MPI-IO functionality is now
  delivered through the Open MPI internal "OMPIO" implementation
  (which has been the default for quite a while, anyway).

- Added MPI-4.1 ``MPI_Status_*`` functions.
