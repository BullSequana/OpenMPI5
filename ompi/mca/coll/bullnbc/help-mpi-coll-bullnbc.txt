[file fail-1]

The coll/bullnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The coll file parser was called with a null filename string.
This is an internal error. Parser should be used only if a rules filename was set by user.

This error leads to bullnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose = 1 (errors)
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose >= 50 (file based rules selection print)
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose >= 100 (file parsing logs print)
#
[file fail-2]

The coll/bullnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The coll file parser was called with a null rules pointer.
This is an internal error. Rules object pointer must be valid.

This error leads to bullnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.

[file fail-3]

The coll/bullnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The coll file parser was called with an invalid max collectives number.
This is an internal error. Max collectives number must be greater than 0.

This error leads to bullnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.

[file fail-4]

The coll/bullnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The file can't be opened. Either file is missing or access rights are wrong.
Check if the file path defined by the mca parameter
OMPI_MCA_coll_bullnbc_dynamic_rules_filename is valid.

[file fail-5]

The coll/bullnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The file format is unknown. It must be either
    0: Rules are defined according to a combination of
       collective_id, communicator size and message size
 or 1: Rules are defined according to a combination of
       collective_id, communicator nodes number, communicator size and message size.

This error leads to bullnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.

[file fail-6]

The coll/bullnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

Rules object allocation failed. This can be induced by a memory resource exhaustion.

[file fail-7]

The coll/bullnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The file parsing aborted. This can be induced by either:
    a format mismatch
 or a missing line
 or an invalid configuration number.

Incosistent collective ID in rules object. This is an internal error.

[Non uniform partitionned, no rma]
Osc algorithm asked for %s but receive types may differ on remote processes.
Put operations need the garantee that is not the case.

Please change your MCA configuration:
 - either change for another algorithm
 - or provide uniform_recv_datatypes MCA hint

[No MPI_IN_PLACE for partitioned]
MPI_IN_PLACE is not supported for partitioned collectives
- your data is not ready yet, so I cannot copy it to fallback on standard cases
- I cannot postpone copy since peers could already have sent the data on received buffer
- I cannot delay peers sends without synchronisation, which is what partitioned try to avoid at most


[Too high partition]
You ask to handle partition %lu but the limit for this %s is at %lu.

[Non uniform partition sizes]
Algorithm %d asked for partitionned %s but there is no hint that partitions
sizes matches with remotes. If this you really want this algorithm, please
activate coll_bullnbc_uniform_partition_count MCA parameter.

Fallback on algorithm %d.
