[flush_err_rma_sync]
Open MPI has detected that this process has attempted a %s
on an MPI window set up non-passive target mode in a MCA configuration
that required to perform an MPI_Flush. This is erroneous.

Please check that is done on purpose and select another osc component that
do not need MPI_Flush for RMA notifications.
